# Usage Observability

## Goal

Persist short-lived usage facts for `/usage` and local diagnostics. The data answers:

- Daily token usage by provider and model.
- Daily user turn count, similar to an activity heatmap.
- Model latency versus tool latency versus whole-turn latency.
- Cache hit and cache creation token volume.
- Error, retry, cancellation, and context-overflow rates.

Usage observability is not a permanent billing ledger. Rows are retained for 30 days and may be
pruned on startup or after writes.

## Source Of Truth

`model_usage` is the canonical token source. One row represents one logical model request recorded
at the runtime boundary, including main turns, compact summaries, title generation, target
completion verification, workflow child sessions, and subagents.

`message` and `part` may keep token snapshots for transcript rendering, but `/usage` must not read
them as the canonical source after this migration. `part` is a UI transcript unit, not a billing or
usage unit.

## Token Fields

Persist provider-normalized token fields separately:

- `input_tokens`
- `output_tokens`
- `reasoning_tokens`
- `cache_creation_input_tokens`
- `cache_read_input_tokens`
- `provider_total_tokens`
- `computed_total_tokens`

`input_tokens` stores provider-normalized total input. For AI SDK v6 Anthropic
usage this already includes ordinary input, cache-hit input, and cache-write
input. `cache_read_input_tokens` is cache-hit volume and
`cache_creation_input_tokens` is cache-write volume; both stay separate only as
breakdown fields so `/usage` can render cache behavior without hiding it.

`computed_total_tokens` is:

```text
input_tokens + output_tokens
```

`reasoning_tokens` is stored as its own provider detail. It is not added to `computed_total_tokens`
by default because providers may already include it in output totals.

## Tables

### `model_usage`

One row per logical model request. The row includes request identity, query source, model identity,
latency, token split, retry/error flags, and raw usage JSON for later adapter debugging.

### `turn_usage`

One row per user turn. The row aggregates model usage and tool usage for that turn. It is the source
for activity-style turn counts and loop-level latency.

### `tool_usage`

One row per tool call. The row tracks tool name, side-effect metadata, approval status, latency,
output byte counts, truncation, errors, and cancellation flags.

Rollups are intentionally deferred. `/usage` can group over 30 days of facts directly; if the facts
grow expensive later, daily rollups can be rebuilt from these tables.

## Retention

The store prunes rows older than 30 days using:

```sql
delete from model_usage where started_at < ?;
delete from turn_usage where started_at < ?;
delete from tool_usage where started_at < ?;
```

The cutoff is `Date.now() - 30 days`. Pruning must never block the model/tool path if it fails; it is
best-effort observability.

## Write Points

- Runtime writes `model_usage` after every successful `ModelComplete` and after model request
  failures when a request reached the runtime boundary.
- Runtime writes `turn_usage` at turn completion or turn error.
- Runtime writes `tool_usage` from tool lifecycle events:
  `tool_call_scheduled`, `permission_requested`, `permission_resolved`,
  `permission_denied`, `tool_call_started`, `tool_call_progress`, `tool_call_result`, and
  `tool_call_error`.

All writes must use trace/session/turn identifiers already present in the runtime trace context.
Statistics rows must not store full prompts, full tool input/output, secrets, tokens, cookies, or
private file contents.

## `/usage` Query Shape

Daily model usage:

```sql
select
  date(started_at / 1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as day,
  provider_id,
  model_id,
  sum(input_tokens) as input_tokens,
  sum(output_tokens) as output_tokens,
  sum(cache_creation_input_tokens) as cache_creation_input_tokens,
  sum(cache_read_input_tokens) as cache_read_input_tokens,
  sum(computed_total_tokens) as computed_total_tokens,
  count(*) as model_request_count,
  avg(duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
  avg(time_to_first_token_ms) as avg_time_to_first_token_ms
from model_usage
where started_at >= ?
group by day, provider_id, model_id
order by day asc;
```

Daily turn activity:

```sql
select
  date(started_at / 1000, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as day,
  count(*) as turn_count,
  sum(computed_total_tokens) as computed_total_tokens
from turn_usage
where started_at >= ?
group by day
order by day asc;
```

Tool latency:

```sql
select
  tool_name,
  count(*) as calls,
  avg(duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
  sum(case when status = 'error' then 1 else 0 end) as error_count
from tool_usage
where started_at >= ?
group by tool_name
order by calls desc;
```

## Tests

- SQLite migration creates all usage tables and indexes.
- SQLite usage repository upserts model, turn, and tool rows and prunes old rows.
- Runtime records main-turn model usage, turn usage, and tool usage.
- Runtime records non-transcript model calls such as session title generation and compact through
  the same `model_usage` path.
